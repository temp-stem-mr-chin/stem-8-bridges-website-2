		<p>
			You can only use 250g of spaghettis and 5 glue sticks. Your score is calculated by Mass Held By Bridge
			(g)/Mass of Bridge (kg). Your Bridge can only be 10cm in width, 60cm in lenght, and 25cm in height.
		</p>

        <p>
         Objective is to make a spaghetti bridge that can hold as much weight as it could possibly hold.
         </p>

		<h3>↓ Here is the scale model of our bridge #1</h3>

		<div class="round">
			<img src="scale%20model.jpeg" heigth="273" width="948" class="float-image" style="float: left" />

			<p>
				The first bridge we built was a truss bridge, it contained 5 sections with triangles facing outwards on
				both sides. Each sections is 5cm long in length. In total the bridge is 60cm long and the top is 50cm
				long, with a heigth of roughly 7cm and a width of 10cm. The total weight of our bridge is 150g. Our
				bridge held 4 pounds because the end of our bridge snaped which lead to us getting 12.1 points.
			</p>
    </div>
    

		<h3>↓ What bridge #1 look like</h3>

		<h3>Problems on our first bridge</h3>

		<p>
			The problem with our bridge is that one of the end wasn't as strong as we expected, so it broke due to the
			force.
		</p>

		<h3>↓ Scale model of bridge #2</h3>
		<img src="scale model2.jpeg" height="264" width="914" style="float: left" />

		<p>
			Our 2nd bridge is a beam like truss bridge a with a length of 58cm it is around 10cm tall and 10cm wide,
			with a weigth of 210g. It has two levels to promote stability and all of the squares are crossbraced with
			triangles. Again this bridge is a truss bridge because we found that these bridges are quite succesful. With
			our previous problems on bridge #1 we decided to thicken up all the compressions 2x the tesions part. So the
			compression part have 4 strands spaghettis while the tension part have 2 strands of spaghettis.

		<h3>Promblems on our second bridge</h3>

		<p>
			With our second bridge we faced a simliler problems with our first bridge. The end of the bridge was weaker
			then we expected again. Which lead us getting 37.1points lifting 7.6kg.
